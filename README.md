# chatty
Platform agnostic chat engine written in Golang. Any DB, any protocol.


Chatty is a chat server lifecycle manager and repository that is platform agnostic. I got very tired of writing the same exact code over and over for gRPC, websockets, and thought it would be nice to have a manager that did this almost as a "microservice" (although I really don't want to call it that). It can be pluggable into any DB, although I am mostly a postgres user so I personally only will end up supporting sqllite, and postgres.

Please send them. I'm an 18 year old full time student with contracting jobs here and there. It is very hard to maintain personal projects, and I would love help in cleaning this up
